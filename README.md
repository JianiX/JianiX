## 🧩 How I Work With Candidates

I don’t operate as a “resume broker”.

For senior-level candidates, I typically support on:
- Role & career trajectory analysis
- Team & technical culture transparency
- Compensation benchmarking (global-aware)
- Interview strategy & expectation alignment
- Offer-level decision support

My principle:
> Long-term fit beats short-term placement.

## 🌱 Why I Study Computer Science

AI can already write code.  
My goal is not to replace engineers — it’s to **understand them at a systems level**.

I’m upgrading my technical foundation to:
- Judge senior technical depth more accurately
- Communicate with engineers in their native language
- Avoid “buzzword hiring”
- Design better **AI-powered hiring & evaluation workflows**

Upgrading toward:
> “System-aware recruiter & builder.”

## 🧩 Current Learning Stack (For Technical Depth)

- **CS50 (Harvard)** – C, algorithms, problem solving  
- **C Programming** – memory, control flow, program structure  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** – long-term foundation  
- **Math Refresh** – linear algebra & discrete math (for ML/RL understanding)  
- Learning notes & small builds:
  👉 [`cs50-learning-log`](https://github.com/JianiX/cs50-learning-log)

Not pursuing a SWE role.  
Pursuing **technical literacy for better judgment and better systems**.

## 🚀 What I’m Building Toward

- AI-powered interview & evaluation systems
- Smarter global hiring infrastructure
- Career acceleration tools for senior & non-traditional tech talent

Long-term goal:
