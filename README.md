# 🌏 Jiani here

I’m a **Senior Talent Acquisition Manager** focused on global tech & AI recruiting, currently working remotely with game & AI teams.

Right now I:
- Partner with engineers and leaders working on **RL, LLMs, Gameplay AI and Anti-Cheat**
- Help build distributed teams across **US / Europe / Asia**
- Work as a **top-rated Upwork recruiter & HR consultant** for international clients

Curious by nature, I like understanding how systems (and people) really work.  
Recently I realised there is one big missing piece in my toolkit: **computer science fundamentals** — so I’m actively fixing that.

## 🌱 My Learning Journey (CS & Tech)

I’m transitioning from “technical recruiter” → “recruiter who can actually read and write code”.

Currently learning:

- **CS50 (Harvard)** – C, algorithms, problem solving  
- **C programming basics** – functions, loops, conditionals  
- **Data structures & algorithms** – preparing for future CS master applications  
- **Math refresh** – linear algebra & discrete math for ML / AI  
- Building small C programs and logging everything in  
  👉 [`cs50-learning-log`](https://github.com/JianiX/cs50-learning-log)

I’m not trying to become a full-time SWE;  
I want to become the kind of TA/People person who can **talk to engineers in their language** and design better systems around them.
